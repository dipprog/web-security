Lab #3 - CORS vulnerability with trusted insecure protocols

Target Goal - Exploit the CORS misconfiguration to retrieve the administrator's API key

Creds - wiener:peter

Analysis:

Testing for CORS misconfigurations:
1. Change origin to an arbitrary value > False
2. Change the origin header to the null value > False
3. Change origin header to one that begins with the origin of the site > False
4. Change the origin header to one that ends with the origin of the site > True -- Now we have to find a subdomain of the site which is vulnerable to XXS attacks.
