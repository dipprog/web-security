Lab #5 - Information disclosure in version control history

Target goal:- Disclose the administrator's credentials and delete the Carlos user.


Download a copy of this entire directory. For Linux users, the easiest way to do this is using the command:
wget -r https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/.git/

Explore the downloaded directory using your local Git installation. Notice that there is a commit with the message "Remove admin password from config".
Look closer at the diff for the changed admin.conf file. Notice that the commit replaced the hard-coded admin password with an environment variable ADMIN_PASSWORD instead. However, the hard-coded password is still clearly visible in the diff.
