Analysis - 

In order for a CSRF attack to be possible:
1. A relevant action - change a user's email
2. Cookie based session handling - session cookie
3. No unpredictable request parameters - CSRF token is not mandatory

Testing CSRF Tokens:
1. Remove the CSRF token and see if application accepts request
    - If token is present, it will check to see whether it is valid or not. If not present, it will not do the checking.
2. Change the request method from POST to GET
