Lab #4 - CSRF where token is not tied to user session

Vulnerable parameter - email change functionality

Goal - exploit CSRF to change email address

Creds - wiener:peter, carlos:mpntoya(attacker credentials)

Analysis - 

In order for a CSRF attack to be possible:
1. A relevant action - change a user's email
2. Cookie based session handling - session cookie
3. No unpredictable request parameters - CSRF is not tied to user's token

Testing CSRF Tokens:
1. Remove the CSRF token and see if application accepts request
    - If token is present, it will check to see whether it is valid or not. If not present, it will not do the checking.
2. Change the request method from POST to GET
3. See if CSRF token is tied to user session
