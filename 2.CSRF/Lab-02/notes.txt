Lab #1 - CSRF vulnerability where token validation on request method

Vulnerable parameter: email change functionality

End goals: Exploit the CSRF vulnerability and change the email address

Creds: wiener * peter

Analysis:
In order for a CSRF attack to be possible:
1. A relevant action - email change functionality
2. Cookie based session handling - session cookie
3. No unpredictable request parameters - Request method can be changed to GET which does not require CSRF token

Testing CSRF Tokens:
1. Change the request method from POST to GET
